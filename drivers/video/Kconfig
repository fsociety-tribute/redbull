	  The device is represented by an out-of-tree video driver
	  in techpack/video.  This config represents the truth regarding
	  the state of the video driver.

	  Default is technically n, but the out of tree driver overrides
	  that to y.  But if this configuration is m, then the out of tree
	  driver will respect that configuration.
